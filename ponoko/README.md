# The Ponoko manufacture file

The _tribatinov.svg_ file contains the design file that can be sent
to [Ponoko](http://www.ponoko.com) for manufacture. This design is for
the 8" classic Meade LX200 telescope. It should be relatively easy to
rescale the design for other telescope sizes.

I have chosen the smallest angle between the diffraction spikes to be 10 deg.

To see the design, you must zoom in because the stroke width is 0.01
mm as required by Ponoko. You have to delete the Copright layer before
sending to Ponoko as well.

A drawing of my design is shown here
