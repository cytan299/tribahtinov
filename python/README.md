# Python script for generating a Tri-Bahtinov Mask

This directory contains the python script for generating a Tri-Bahtinov mask for your telescope.

## Required libraries

Here are the necessary libraries and python programs necessary to get
the python script to work:

* **pip** This python script is necessary for installing the cairocffi
library. On _Mac OS X_, do the following:
```
sudo easy_install pip
```
On _Linux_,  (I cannot test this, because I don't run _Linux_), 
the pip python script can be downloaded from
[here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). It is installed using
```
python get-pip.py
```
* **cairocffi** For my python script to work, it is necessary to
  install the [cairocffi](https://github.com/SimonSapin/cairocffi)
  library. Do the following to install it
  ```
  sudo -H pip install cairocffi
```
