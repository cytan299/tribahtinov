# Tri-Bahtinov mask cover generators

This directory contains the python code for generating a Tri-Bahtinov mask cover for either the original Tri-Bahtinov mask or S. Takagi's improved Tri-Bahtinov mask. These masks are useful when used in conjunction with the K. Evans' [Tri-Bahtinov
Grabber program](https://github.com/1CM69/Tri-Bahtinov_Grabber).
