# Other formats

Here are other formats of the Tri-Bahtinov mask that might be useful
for you to modify and print.

* **tribahtinov.pdf** PDF format of the mask. This is readable with Acrobat Reader.
* **tribahtinov.eps** Encapsulated postscript. This is readable with ghostscript.
* **tribahtinov.dwg** DWG file that is readable with Autocad.
* **tribahtinov.dxf** DXF file that is readable with many CAD programs like LibreCad.

All the files contain a 1 inch square drawing so that you can check the size of your printout matches what I intend the size of the Tri-Bahtinov mask to be.
