# The Ponoko manufacture file

The _tribatinov.svg_ file contains the design file that can be sent to
[Ponoko](http://www.ponoko.com) to be laser cut. This design is for
the 8" classic Meade LX200 telescope. The svg file can be read with
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) and using Inscape It should be
relatively easy to rescale and edit the design for other telescope sizes.

I have chosen the smallest angle between the diffraction spikes to be
10 deg. in this design.

To see the design, you must zoom in because the stroke width is 0.01
mm as required by Ponoko. You have to delete the Copright layer before
sending to Ponoko as well. The material that I have chosen for the mask is 3
mm Black Acrylic in P2 size.

A drawing of my design is shown here

Other formats for the Tri-Bahtinov mask can be found in the
[other formats](https://github.com/cytan299/tribahtinov/blob/master/pics/other_formats) directory.
